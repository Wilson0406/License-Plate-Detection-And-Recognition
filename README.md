# License-Plate-Detection-And-Recognition

License plate detection is identifying the part of the car that is predicted to be the number plate. Recognition is identifying the values that make up the license plate.

License plate detection and recognition is the technology that uses computer vision to detect and recognize a license plate from an input image of a car.

This technology applies in many areas. On roads, it is used to identify the cars that are breaking the traffic rules. In security, it is used to capture the license plates of the vehicles getting into and out of certain premises. In parking lots, it is used to capture the license plates of the cars being parked. The list of its applications goes on and on.

For software to detect and recognize a license plate, it undergoes three major processes.
1. **Taking an image of a car as input** - The program takes in the input of the car in which the license plate is to be detected.
2. **Processing the input** - The image taken as the input undergoes processing to detect the part of the car that is the license plate.
3. **Recognizing the number plate** - The values of the detected license plate are extracted from the number plate image.
